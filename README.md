# Restaurant Reviews App Stage 1
---

## Project Overview:
This project is a simple restaurant web application. 

**My main puprose was make:**
1. Responsive Design
* Site UI compatible with a range of display sizes.
* All images are responsive.
* Application elements visible and usable in all viewports.
2. Accessibility:
* All images are accessible.
* Focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site.
* Site elements defined semantically.
3. Offline Availability:
* Pages that have been visited available offline.


### Getting Started
1. Download and unpack [archive](https://github.com/Moramu/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
